### Software zur Simulation des Schleifspindeldesigns (Grinding Spindle Design Simulation Software)

* Simulates spindle performance across scenarios (High-Speed, High-Torque, Balanced) and time-based simulations.
* Generates dynamic load profiles with sinusoidal variation and random spikes to simulate real-world conditions.
* Uses a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm with historical data to predict maintenance needs.
* Provides comprehensive reports with scenario summaries and recommendations (e.g., switch to liquid cooling if temperature is high).
* Generates a maintenance schedule based on bearing type, lubrication type, and operating hours.
* Includes tasks like bearing inspection, lubrication maintenance, vibration monitoring, alignment checks, and general maintenance.
* Shows performance metrics (vibration, temperature, power, load, bearing life, spindle life, wheel wear) as color-coded bars (green for acceptable, red for exceeding thresholds).
* Covers a wide range of spindle performance aspects (power, thermal, vibration, fatigue, wear) with realistic calculations.
* The k-NN-based maintenance prediction adds predictive maintenance capabilities, enhancing practical utility.
